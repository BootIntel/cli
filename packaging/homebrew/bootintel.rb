# Reference copy of the formula published at BootIntel/homebrew-tap.
#
# The tap is what users install from:
#
#   brew tap bootintel/tap
#   brew install bootintel
#
# THE TAP IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. This file is a copy for review and for
# bootstrapping the tap if it ever has to be recreated; nothing installs from
# it. It sat at 0.5.0 while 0.6.0, 0.6.1 and 0.7.0 shipped, because the release
# checklist did not name the tap as a step; that is now fixed in
# docs/releasing.md. A stale copy of a formula is worse than no copy: it invites
# someone to trust the checksums in it.
#
# Keep this byte-identical to the tap's Formula/bootintel.rb apart from this
# header, so a diff between them is a real finding rather than noise.
